# Stack
Companies often ask to complete test tasks without any additional frameworks or libraries, so I did this one without any of that.

# Level Generator
The levels are not unique, meaning there can be more than one solution. I built a level generator and tried optimizing it multiple times, and eventually realized that generating unique levels with non-obvious solutions on the fly is not feasible â€” it takes too much time. I could have created levels using Scriptable Object configs, but I figured a generator for non-unique levels would be a better choice. Especially since, after some testing, I found that non-unique levels can actually be more challenging to solve.
