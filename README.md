# Stack
Companies often ask to complete test tasks without any additional frameworks or libraries, so I did this one without any of that.

# Level Generator
The levels are not unique, meaning there can be more than one solution. I built a level generator and tried optimizing it multiple times, and eventually realized that generating unique levels with non-obvious solutions on the fly is not feasible — it takes too much time. I could have created levels using Scriptable Object configs, but I figured a generator for non-unique levels would be a better choice. Especially since, after some testing, I found that non-unique levels can actually be more challenging to solve.

# Thoughts on input
I think it's a bit inconvenient that you have to follow the grid squares to draw a line. It would be more intuitive and comfortable if you could start a virtual line from anywhere on the screen and draw it in any direction, and it would appear in the same direction on the grid.

# Animations
Сould add more animations. But in my opinion, a more minimalistic and strict design suits puzzle games well. It's a matter of personal taste.
